# Bookmeter-Refactored: Refactoring Plan - Introduction

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the `bookmeter-refactored` project. The primary goals are to enhance maintainability, apply Clean Architecture and functional programming principles consistently, and ensure a clear and robust codebase centered around types and functions.

## 1. Current Structure Overview

The project currently follows a layered architecture, which is a good foundation:

-   **`application/`**: Contains use cases and port definitions (interfaces for infrastructure).
    -   `ports/output/`: Defines interfaces for external services like repositories, scrapers, and loggers.
    -   `usecases/`: Implements application-specific business logic, orchestrating domain objects and infrastructure services.
-   **`data/`**: Intended for persistent data, currently holding `books.sqlite`.
-   **`domain/`**: Houses the core business logic, entities, and value objects.
    -   `models/`: Includes domain entities (e.g., `Book`), value objects, and custom `Result` and error types.
    -   `services/`: Contains domain-specific services (e.g., `IsbnService`).
-   **`infrastructure/`**: Provides concrete implementations (adapters) for the ports defined in the application layer.
    -   `adapters/apis/`: Clients for various external book information APIs.
    -   `adapters/logging/`: Logging implementations (e.g., `ConsoleLogger`).
    -   `adapters/repositories/`: Data access implementations (e.g., `SqliteBookRepository`).
    -   `adapters/scraping/`: Web scraping logic (e.g., `BookmeterScraper`, `KinokuniyaScraper`).
    -   `adapters/storage/`: File system operations (e.g., `FileStorageService`).
    -   `utils/`: Utilities specific to infrastructure concerns.
-   **`presentation/`**: Handles user interaction, program entry points, and dependency injection.
    -   `cli/`: Command-line interface specific logic.
    -   `di/`: Dependency injection container setup.
    -   `index.ts`: The main entry point for the application.
-   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration for the project.

This structure aligns well with Clean Architecture principles, establishing clear boundaries between different concerns.

## 2. High-Level Refactoring Goals

The refactoring process will focus on:

-   **Strengthening Clean Architecture Adherence**: Ensuring strict adherence to dependency rules (e.g., domain layer having no knowledge of infrastructure).
-   **Enhancing Functional Programming Style**:
    -   Prioritizing pure functions and immutability where practical.
    -   Clearly separating side effects.
    -   Leveraging TypeScript's type system for robust functional patterns.
-   **Improving Code Clarity and Simplicity**:
    -   Reducing unnecessary complexity and boilerplate.
    -   Ensuring consistent naming conventions and coding styles.
    -   Refining abstractions to be more intuitive and effective.
-   **Optimizing File and Module Organization**:
    -   Ensuring logical grouping of related code.
    -   Breaking down large files into smaller, more manageable modules.
-   **Type System Refinement**:
    -   Maximizing type safety and leveraging advanced TypeScript features for better domain modeling.
    -   Ensuring clarity and precision in type definitions.
-   **Error Handling Strategy**:
    -   Consistently applying the `Result` type for business exceptions and `try-catch` for technical exceptions, as per the `.clinerules`.

## 3. Next Steps

The following sections will delve into specific areas of the codebase, proposing concrete refactoring actions for each layer and cross-cutting concern. This will involve:

-   Detailed review of domain models and services.
-   Analysis of application use cases and their interactions with ports.
-   Examination of infrastructure adapters for efficiency, correctness, and adherence to defined ports.
-   Review of presentation layer logic, including DI and CLI interactions.

This iterative approach will allow for focused improvements across the entire project.
